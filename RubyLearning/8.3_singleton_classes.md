# Eigen class or Meta class or Singleton class

* Eigen class also known as **meta-class, shadow-class, singleton class**

## Singleton methods

* Singleton method - method that is defined only for a single object.

> Singleton methods of an object are not instance methods of the class of the object; rather, they are instance methods of the singleton class of the object. - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/212407/what-exactly-is-the-singleton-class-in-ruby)

## Self inside singleton method

* `self` inside a singleton method is the object whose singleton method it is.

~~~ruby
module SimpleModule
  def simple_method
    puts "Inside the simple method of the instance #{self.name}"
  end
end

class SimpleClass
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

simple_class = SimpleClass.new("John")

# this module is included only in this instance of `SimpleClass`
simple_class.extend(SimpleModule)
simple_class.simple_method
puts simple_class.object_id

# since the singleton_method below is defined only for the
# instance simple_class
def simple_class.singleton_method
  # self refers to the simple_class instance itself
  puts "#{self.object_id}"
end

simple_class.singleton_method
