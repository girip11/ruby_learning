# Variable scopes

* Global variables have global scope. Available to entire program. Global variables start with **$**

* [Builtin global variables](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/variable.html#question)
  * `$0` - name of ruby file under execution
  * `$:` - Directories that make up search path for loading external file
  * `$$` - pid of the ruby process
  * `$?` - pid of the last executed child process

* Local scope - visible within a method, class, module. Even if the variable is defined outside all the definition blocks it will still be part of the **main object scope**.
